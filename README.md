### Data Architecture
- Quiz data stored in JSON format
- Data pipeline: Excel files → JSON conversion → JSON compression
- Client-side caching for improved performance

### Language Support
- Primary interface language: Vietnamese
- Quiz content, instructions, and UI elements are in Vietnamese
- Column headers in Excel files use Vietnamese terminology (e.g., "Câu hỏi", "Đáp án đúng")

  "question": "Nội dung câu hỏi",
  "options": [
    "Đáp án 1",
    "Đáp án 2",
    "Đáp án 3",
    "Đáp án 4"
  ],
  "correctAnswerIndex": 0, // Zero-based index (0-3)
  "source": "Trích dẫn nguồn"
}
```

### Quiz Manifest
A central manifest file (`quiz_manifest.json`) maintains an index of all available quizzes:
```json
[
  {
    "name": "Quiz Name/Category",
    "file": "data/quiz-filename.json",
    "size": 12345 // File size in bytes (for progress indication)
  },
  ...
]
```

## Build and Development Process

### Development Environment
- Node.js for build scripts
- Development workflow with npm scripts
- Support for Vietnamese character encoding (UTF-8)

### Build Pipeline
1. **Data Conversion**: Excel to JSON conversion using the `xlsx` library
   - Command: `npm run convert`
   - Reads from `./quizzes` directory
   - Outputs to `./data` directory

2. **Optimization**: Compression and minification
   - JSON compression: `npm run compress`
   - HTML minification: Part of `npm run optimize`
   - Combined process: `npm run build`

3. **Deployment**: GitHub Pages optimized
   - Automated via GitHub Actions workflow

## Performance Optimization

### Network Optimization
- Compressed JSON files to reduce transfer size
- Browser caching via Cache-Control headers
- Service worker for offline capability and faster loading

### Runtime Optimization
- In-memory caching to prevent redundant data fetching
- Lazy loading of non-essential resources
- Minified CSS and HTML for faster parsing

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile browsers on iOS and Android
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers

## Future Enhancements
1. Offline mode with full functionality
2. Enhanced statistics and analytics
3. User accounts and progress tracking
4. Additional quiz formats beyond multiple-choice

## Limitations
- Maximum quiz file size determined by client-side memory constraints
- Requires JavaScript to be enabled
- Limited offline capability with current implementation

## Localization
- UI text and labels in Vietnamese
- Error messages and instructions in Vietnamese
- Date and time formats following Vietnamese conventions
- Quiz categories reflect Vietnamese professional domains and specializations
